# TempConvertPro
## Description
TempConvertPro is an intuitive temperature conversion tool that allows users to convert temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius. It features a graphical user interface made with swift that I created.

## Usage Instructions
Open TempConvertPro using one of the methods described above.
Enter a temperature in either the Fahrenheit or Celsius field.
Press 'Calculate' to convert the temperature to the other unit.
Use the 'Reset' button to clear all fields and perform a new conversion.
If the application does not start, ensure you have the correct version of Java installed and that the JAR file permissions are correctly set (executable).
